# Machine Learning Projects
Compilation of ML project tutorials using TensorFlow, Keras, Sci-kit, etc.

## Boston Housing :house_with_garden::derelict_house::hotel:	
Boston housing dataset from sci-kit learn that contains features of homes (ex. square feet, number of rooms, etc) and labeled average price of the homes. A linear regression model was used courtesy of sci-kit library along with error calculating in order to test accuracy of model. Great introduction to sci-kit and it's powerful libraries.

## MNIST Fashion :shirt::jeans::mans_shoe:
MNIST fashion dataset from tensorflow (keras) was used for this project. It contains numerous images of different articles of clothing. A convolutional nerual network (CNN) model was built in order to properly identify the category of clothing (ex. sweater, pants, shoes, etc.) Different techniques such as maxpooling and dropout were applied to make an accurate model.

## Iris :bouquet::cherry_blossom::sunflower:	
The sci-kit Iris dataset contains data for 3 different type of flower irises' (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) and their labels. A mix of 6 linear and non-linear supervised learning algorithms were explored in order to accurately model the data. After cross-validation, two models were further explored and tested on a test dataset.
